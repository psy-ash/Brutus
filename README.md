A General Web Botting Program WIP


Just an idea I had to make website botting more user friendly

uses microsofts WebView2, and a few other dependancies i'll add to this list later

Avoids direct programming knowledge being needed.
You can right click webpage elements and customise the event on the timeline to control the bot.


lots of missing features (example: copy/paste, settings) i'm new to using github so i'm still filling things out on here
comments and contributions are welcome
